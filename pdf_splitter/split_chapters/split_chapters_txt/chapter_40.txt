Chapter 40
RUBBER AND ARTICLES THEREOF
Notes.
1. Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout the Nomenclature the expression "rubber" means the following
products, whether or not vulcanised or hard: natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural gums,
synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed.
2. This Chapter does not cover:
(a) Goods of Section XI (textiles and textile articles);
(b) Footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64;
(c) Headgear or parts thereof (including bathing caps) of Chapter 65;
(d) Mechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof of Section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of hard rubber;
(e) Articles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96; or
(f) Articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mittens and mitts and articles of headings 40.11 to 40.13).
3. In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05, the expression "primary forms" applies only to the following forms:
(a) Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised, and other dispersions and solutions);
(b) Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms.
4. In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression "synthetic rubber" applies to:
(a) Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into
non-thermoplastic substances which, at a temperature between 18°C and 29°C, will not break on being extended to three
times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes,
to a length not greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purpose of this test, substances necessary
for the cross-linking, such as vulcanising activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as
provided for by Note 5 (B) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted. However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the
cross-linking, such as extenders, plasticisers and fillers, is not permitted;
(b) Thioplasts (TM); and
(c) Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated
synthetic substances with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the above-mentioned products comply with
the requirements concerning vulcanisation, elongation and recovery in (a) above.
5. (A) Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after
coagulation, with:
(i) vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised
rubber latex);
(ii) pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification;
(iii) plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic
solvents or any other substances, except those permitted under (B);
(B) The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading
40.01 or 40.02, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a
raw material:
(i) emulsifiers or anti-tack agents;
(ii) small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers;
(iii) very small amounts of the following: heat-sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes),
cationic surface-active agents (generally for obtaining electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants,
crumbling agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilisers, viscosity-control agents, or similar
special-purpose additives.

6. For the purpose of heading 40.04, the expression "waste, parings and scrap" means rubber waste, parings and scrap from
the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting-up, wear or other
reasons.
7. Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5 mm, is to be classified as strip, rods
or profile shapes, of heading 40.08.
8. Heading 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated
with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber.
9. In headings 40.01, 40.02, 40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the expressions "plates", "sheets" and "strip" apply only to plates, sheets
and strip and to blocks of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or
not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface-worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or
further worked. In heading 40.08 the expressions "rods" and "profile shapes" apply only to such products, whether or not cut
to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.
