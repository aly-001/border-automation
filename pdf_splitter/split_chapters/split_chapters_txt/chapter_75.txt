Chapter 75

Subheading Notes.
1. In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:
(a) Nickel, not alloyed
Metal containing by weight at least 99% of nickel plus cobalt, provided that:
(i) the cobalt content by weight does not exceed 1.5%, and
(ii) the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:
TABLE - Other elements

Element

Fe
Iron
O
Oxygen
Other elements, each

Limiting content % by weight

0.5
0.4
0.3

(b) Nickel alloys
Metallic substances in which nickel predominates by weight over each of the other elements provided that:
(i) the content by weight of cobalt exceeds 1.5%,
(ii) the content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or
(iii) the total content by weight of elements other than nickel plus cobalt exceeds 1%.
2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Note 9 (c) to Section XV, for the purposes of subheading 7508.10 the term "wire" applies
only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6 mm.
Supplementary Note.
1. In this Chapter the expression "unworked", when referring to foil, means products which have not been processed beyond the
condition as from the rolling mill (for example, not machined, cut to shape, perforated or coated).
Statistical Note.
(NB This note does not form part of the Customs Tariff legislation.)
1. For the statistical purposes of subheading 7501.10, the unit of measure (kilogram) refers to the nickel content of the matte and
shall be the assay quantity without deductions.
