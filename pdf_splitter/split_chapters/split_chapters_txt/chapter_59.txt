58 or 60); for the purpose of this provision, no account should be taken of any resulting change of colour;
(2) Products which cannot, without fracturing, be bent manually around a cylinder of a diameter of 7 mm, at a temperature
between 15°C and 30°C (usually Chapter 39);
(3) Products in which the textile fabric is either completely embedded in plastics or entirely coated or covered on both
