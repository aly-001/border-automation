fibres (marl or mixture yarns), or is printed in one or more colours at intervals to give the impression of dots;
(iii) is obtained from slivers or rovings which have been printed; or

(The following are also regarded as printed woven fabrics: woven fabrics bearing designs made, for example, with a brush
or spray gun, by means of transfer paper, by flocking or by the batik process.)
The process of mercerization does not affect the classification of yarns or fabrics within the above categories.
The definitions at (d) to (h) above apply, mutatis mutandis, to knitted or crocheted fabrics.
(ij) Plain weave

2. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly
of that textile material which would be selected under Note 2 to this Section for the classification of a product of
Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 58.09 consisting of the same textile materials.
(B) For the application of this rule:
(a) where appropriate, only the part which determines the classification under Interpretative Rule 3 shall be taken into
