2. (A) Products of Chapters 56 to 63 containing two or more textile materials are to be regarded as consisting wholly
of that textile material which would be selected under Note 2 to this Section for the classification of a product of
Chapters 50 to 55 or of heading 58.09 consisting of the same textile materials.
(B) For the application of this rule:
