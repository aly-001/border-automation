Chapter 69
CERAMIC PRODUCTS
Notes.
1. This Chapter applies only to ceramic products which have been fired after shaping:
(a) Headings 69.04 to 69.14 apply only to such products other than those classifiable in headings 69.01 to 69.03;
(b) Articles heated to temperatures less than 800°C for purposes such as curing of resins, accelerating hydration reactions, or
for the removal of water or other volatile components, are not considered to be fired. Such articles are excluded from
Chapter 69; and
(c) Ceramic articles are obtained by firing inorganic, non-metallic materials which have been prepared and shaped previously
at, in general, room temperature. Raw materials comprise, inter alia, clays, siliceous materials including fused silica,
materials with a high melting point, such as oxides, carbides, nitrides, graphite or other carbon, and in some cases
binders such as refractory clays or phosphates.
2. This Chapter does not cover:
(a) Products of heading 28.44;
(b) Articles of heading 68.04;
(c) Articles of Chapter 71 (for example, imitation jewellery);

1. For the statistical purposes of classification Nos. 6909.90.00.10, 6911.10.90.10 and 6911.90.00.10, the description “subject to
