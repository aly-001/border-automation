Chapter 54
MAN-MADE FILAMES; STRIP AND THE LIKE OF MAN-MADE TEXTILE MATERIALS
Notes.
1. Throughout the Nomenclature, the term "man-made fibres" means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced
by manufacturing processes, either:
(a) By polymerisation of organic monomers to produce polymers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins or
polyurethanes, or by chemical modification of polymers produced by this process (for example, poly(vinyl alcohol)
prepared by the hydrolysis of poly(vinyl acetate)); or
(b) By dissolution or chemical treatment of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose) to produce polymers such as
cuprammonium rayon (cupro) or viscose rayon, or by chemical modification of natural organic polymers (for example
cellulose, casein and other proteins, or alginic acid), to produce polymers such as cellulose acetate or alginates.
The terms "synthetic" and "artificial", used in relation to fibres, mean: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial: fibres as
defined at (b). Strip and the like of heading 54.04 or 54.05 are not considered to be man-made fibres.
The terms "man-made", "synthetic" and "artificial" shall have the same meanings when used in relation to "textile materials".
2. Headings 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of Chapter 55.
