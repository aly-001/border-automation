Chapter 62
ARTICLES OF APPAREL AND CLOTHING ACCESSORIES
NOT KED OR CROCHETED
Notes.
1. This Chapter applies only to made up articles of any textile fabric other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles
(other than those of heading 62.12).
2. This Chapter does not cover:
(a) Worn clothing or other worn articles of heading 63.09; or
(b) Orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading 90.21).
3. For the purposes of heading 62.03 and 62.04:
(a) The term "suit" means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in
identical fabric and comprising:
-

one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover
the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as
the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the
suit coat or jacket; and

-

one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than
swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

All of the components of a "suit" must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the
same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn
into the seam) in a different fabric.
If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of
trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of
trousers or, in the case of women's or girls' suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered
separately.
The term "suit" includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:
-

morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped
trousers;

-

evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black cloth, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close
and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;

-

dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the
shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels.

(b) The term "ensemble" means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 62.07 or 62.08) composed of
several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:
-

one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body with the exception of waistcoats which may also form a
second upper garment, and

-

one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace
overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.

All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also
must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term "ensemble" does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading
62.11.

4. Headings 62.05 and 62.06 do not cover garments with pockets below the waist, with a ribbed waistband or other means of
tightening at the bottom of the garment. Heading 62.05 does not cover sleeveless garments.
“Shirts” and “shirt-blouses” are garments designed to cover the upper part of the body, having long or short sleeves and a full
or partial opening starting at the neckline. “Blouses” are loose-fitting garments also designed to cover the upper part of the
body but may be sleeveless and with or without an opening at the neckline. “Shirts”, “shirt-blouses” and “blouses” may also
have a collar.

5 For the purpose of heading 62.09:
(a) The expression "babies' garments and clothing accessories" means articles for young children of a body height not
exceeding 86 cm
(b) Articles which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 62.09 and in other headings of this Chapter are to be classified
in heading 62.09.
6. Garments which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 62.10 and in other headings of this Chapter, excluding heading
62.09, are to be classified in heading 62.10.
7. For the purpose of heading 62.11, "ski suits" means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and
texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country or alpine). They consist either of:
(a) a "ski overall", that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to
sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or
(b) a "ski ensemble", that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:
-

one garment such as an anorak, wind-cheater, wind-jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper)
possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and

-

one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.

The "ski ensemble" may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of
padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.
All the components of a "ski ensemble" must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or
not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.
8. Scarves and articles of the scarf type, square or approximately square, of which no side exceeds 60 cm, are to be classified
as handkerchiefs (heading 62.13). Handkerchiefs of which any side exceeds 60 cm are to be classified in heading 62.14.
9. Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men's or boys' garments, and
those designed for right over left closure at the front as women's or girls' garments. These provisions do not apply where the
cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.
Garments which cannot be identified as either men's or boys' garments or as women's or girls' garments are to be classified
in the headings covering women's or girls' garments.
10. Articles of this Chapter may be made of metal thread.
