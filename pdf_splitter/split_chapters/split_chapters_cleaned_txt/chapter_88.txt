Chapter 88
AIRCRAFT, SPACECRAFT, AND PARTS THEREOF

Note.
1. For the purposes of this Chapter, the expression “unmanned aircraft” means any aircraft, other than those of heading 88.01
designed to be flown without a pilot on board. They may be designed to carry a payload or equipped with permanently integrated
digital cameras or other equipment which would enable them to perform utilitarian functions during their flight.
The expression “unmanned aircraft”, however, does not cover flying toys, designed solely for amusement purposes (heading
95.03).
Subheading Note.
1. For the purpose of subheadings 8802.11 to 8802.40, the expression "unladen weight" means the weight of the machine in
normal flying order, excluding the weight of the crew and of fuel and equipment other than permanently fitted items of
equipment.
2. For the purposes of subheadings 8806.21 to 8806.24 and 8806.91 to 8806.94, the expression "maximum take-off weight"
means the maximum weight of the machine in normal flying order, at take-off, including the weight of payload, equipment and
fuel.
