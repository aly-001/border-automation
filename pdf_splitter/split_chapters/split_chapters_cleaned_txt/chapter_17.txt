Subheading Notes.
1.

For the purpose of subheading 1701.12, 1701.13 and 1701.14, "raw sugar" means sugar whose content of sucrose by
weight, in the dry state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of less than 99.5°.

2.

Subheading 1701.13 covers only cane sugar obtained without centrifugation, whose content of sucrose by weight, in the dry
state, corresponds to a polarimeter reading of 69° or more but less than 93°. The product contains only natural anhedral
microcrystals, of irregular shape, not visible to the naked eye, which are surrounded by residues of molasses and other
constituents of sugar cane.
